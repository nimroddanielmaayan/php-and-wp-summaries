# Coding With WP and Elementor

## General

### General

- One good way to add custom code to WP\Elementor is by using a child theme and
  adding shortcodes to the functions.php file. Then, these shortcodes can be
  used anywhere in the Elementor editor

- It's also possible to use the plugin WPCode to add custom code to an Elementor
  site. Each snippet is like a "mini-plugin" that can be activated or
  deactivated, inserted as a shortcode, etc
